ANSWER
1. Activity Bar: Located on the left side, it provides quick access to various features like files, debugging, and extensions.
2. Side Bar: Displays the file explorer, outline, and other views.
3. Editor Group: The main area where your code is displayed.
4. Status Bar: Shows information about the current file, line and column numbers, and errors.


4. Command Palette:
What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.

ANSWER
The Command Palette in VS Code is a feature that allows you to quickly access various commands and features within the editor. It is like a search interface for VS Code functions, where you can perform tasks without navigating through the menus or remembering keyboard shortcuts. 

To access the Command Palette:
- Press Ctrl+Shift+P if you’re using Windows or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS.
- Start typing the action you want to perform, and it will dynamically search and display a list of commands that match your input.
For example, you can:
- Open files directly by typing >Open File.
- View and run available tasks by typing >Tasks: Run Task.
- Access Git commands by typing >Git:.
- Change settings by typing >Preferences: Open Settings.


5. Extensions in VS Code:
Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

ANSWER
Finding Extensions:
- Open VS Code and click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar (or use the shortcut ⇧⌘X on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+X on Windows/Linux).
- In the Extensions view, you’ll see a list of popular extensions from the VS Code Marketplace. Each extension includes a brief description, publisher information, download count, and a rating.
- Use the search box to filter extensions by keywords (e.g., “todo” for the TODO Highlight extension).

Installing Extensions:
- Once you find an extension, click the “Install” button.
- After installation, the button changes to a “Manage” gear icon.
For example, let’s install the “TODO Highlight” extension (wayou.vscode-todo-highlight). It highlights “TODO:” and “FIXME:” comments in your code.
- To see it in action, open any source code file and add a “TODO:” comment.

Managing Extensions:
- Click the gear icon to manage installed extensions.
- You can disable, uninstall, or configure extensions.
- Configure extension settings in the Settings editor (⌘, or Ctrl,).

Some essential extensions for web development include:
- HTML Snippets: Provides HTML code snippets for faster development
- CSS IntelliSense: Offers CSS code completion, diagnostics, and formatting
- JavaScript (ES6) code snippets: Includes JavaScript code snippets for common tasks
- ESLint: Integrates ESLint into VS Code for code linting and formatting
- Debugger for Chrome: Allows debugging of JavaScript code in the Chrome browser
- Path Intellisense: Provides auto-completion for file paths
- Auto Close Tag: Automatically closes HTML tags
- Auto Rename Tag: Automatically renames paired HTML ta

6. Integrated Terminal:
Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?


ANSWER
I. Opening the Integrated Terminal:
- Use the keyboard shortcut ⌃` (Windows/Linux: Ctrl+`) to toggle the terminal panel.
- To create a new terminal, press ⌃⇧` (Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+`).
- Alternatively, you can go to the menu and choose either “View” > “Terminal” or “Terminal” > “New Terminal” 1.

Advantages of the Integrated Terminal:
Seamless Integration: The integrated terminal starts at the root of your workspace, making it easy to navigate project directories and run commands related to your code.

Links and Error Detection: It integrates with the editor, allowing you to click on links (e.g., URLs) and detect errors directly in the terminal.

Same Commands as Standalone Terminal: You can run common commands (e.g., mkdir, git) just like you would in an external terminal.

Shell Integration: It supports various shells installed on your machine, and you can configure your preferred shell


7. File and Folder Management:
Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?

ANSWER
Creating and Opening Files/Folders:
I. To create a new file or folder:
- Use the keyboard shortcut ⌘N (Windows/Linux: Ctrl+N) to create a new file.
-  Right-click on a folder in the Explorer panel and choose “New File” or “New Folder.”

Ii. To open an existing folder:
- Go to File > Open Folder… and select the desired folder.
- Alternatively, if you’re in the terminal, use code . to open the current folder 

Managing Files and Folders:
- VS Code automatically tracks configuration, open files, and editor layout for each folder you open.
- You can add folder-specific configurations like workspace settings, task definitions, and debugging launch files.
- Multi-root workspaces allow you to include multiple distinct folders in the same workspace by creating a .code-workspace file 2.
- To add a folder to an existing workspace, use the File > Add Folder to Workspace… command 

Efficient Navigation:
I. Quick File Navigation:
- Use ⌘P (Windows/Linux: Ctrl+P) to quickly open any file by its name (Quick Open).
- Hold Ctrl and press Tab to view a list of open files, then release Ctrl to open the desired file 

Breadcrumbs:
The Breadcrumbs bar above the editor shows your current location (folder, file, and symbols).
- Click on breadcrumbs to navigate between folders, files, and symbols.
- Customize breadcrumb appearance using settings

Keyboard Shortcuts:
Use ⌃- (Windows Alt+Left, Linux Ctrl+Alt±) and ⌃⇧- (Windows Alt+Right, Linux Ctrl+Shift±) to navigate between files and edit locations 4.


8. Settings and Preferences:
Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.

ANSWER
User Settings:
- Open VS Code.
- Navigate to File > Preferences > Settings.
- Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut ⌘, (Windows/Linux: Ctrl+,).
This opens the Settings editor, where you can review and modify various options1

Workspace Settings (specific to the current project):
